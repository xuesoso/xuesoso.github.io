**Yuan Soso Xue (YSX)**

## Hello! I am a PhD student in the Bioengineering program at Stanford University

I apply nucleic acids sequencing and machine learning (and sometimes biochemistry) to deepen our understanding of biology.

Recently, I applied single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the sexual development of [parasitic worm](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364166v1) and the asexual development of a [brain-inhabiting single-celled parasite](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/656165v1.article-metrics).
