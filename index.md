I am a Bioengineering PhD candidate in the [Quake lab](https://quakelab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I am currrently interested in applying nucleic acids measurement and analysis to deepen our understanding of biological systems.

Recently, my work resolved the sexual development of single cells in a [parasitic worm](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364166v1) and the asexual development of a [brain-dwelling single-celled parasite](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/656165v1.article-metrics).
