I am a bioinformatics scientist at [Bluestar Genomics](https://www.bluestargenomics.com/) where I continue to push the limit of non-invasive liquid biopsy tests for early cancer detection. I currently help lead the process optimization and technology implementation efforts in the company by leveraging my past experience in genomics and bioinformatics.

I obtained my PhD in bioengineering while studying the single-cell biology of host-pathogen interactions in the [Quake lab](https://quakelab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. My dissertation work resolved the sexual development of single cells in a [parasitic worm](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48994) and the asexual development of a [brain-dwelling single-celled parasite](https://elifesciences.org/articles/54129).
