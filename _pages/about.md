I am a Bioengineering PhD candidate in the [Quake lab](https://quakelab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I am currrently interested in applying nucleic acids measurement and analysis to deepen our understanding of biological systems.

Recently, my work resolved the sexual development of single cells in a [parasitic worm](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48994) and the asexual development of a [brain-dwelling single-celled parasite](https://github.com/xuesoso/singleToxoplasmaSeq).
