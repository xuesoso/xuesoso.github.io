I am a Bioengineering PhD candidate in the [Quake lab](https://quakelab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I am currrently interested in applying nucleic acids measurement and analysis to deepen our understanding of biological systems.

Recently, my work resolved the sexual development of single cells in a [parasitic worm](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48994) and the asexual development of a [brain-dwelling single-celled parasite](https://elifesciences.org/articles/54129).

If you are interested in connecting, please feel free to reach out to [my email](mailto:yuanxue@stanford.edu).
