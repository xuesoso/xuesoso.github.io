I am a bioinformatics scientist at [ClearNote Health](https://www.clearnotehealth.com/), specializing in early-cancer detection technologies using blood samples. In my current role, I help lead the process optimization and technology implementation initiatives drawing on my extensive background in genomics and bioinformatics. I perform quantitative modeling and statistical analysis to improve measurement. Additionally, I engage in computational research to deepen our understanding of the tissue origins of cfDNA and epigenetic modifications.

My academic background includes a PhD study that was co-advised by [Dr. Stephen Quake](https://quakelab.stanford.edu/) and [Dr. John Boothroyd](https://med.stanford.edu/boothroydlab/lab-members/john-boothroyd.html). During this period, I was curious and interested in how pathogens and symbionts, stemming from diverse evolutionary origins, evade host immune responses and establish a "peaceful" co-existence with the host. To address these questions, my dissertation work focused on the development and application of single-cell technology to characterize various biological systems and their interactions with hosts. Some of the organisms that I studied during my PhD include *Toxoplasma gondii* (a prevalent protozoan parasite that can persist in humans for life), *Salmonella Typhimurium* (intracellular bacteria that can persist in host tissues), *Schistosome mansoni* (a parasitic flatworm). For more details on my academic research, please see my [research projects](publications).
